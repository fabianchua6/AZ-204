    "answer": "Changes in application load that are predictable are good candidates for autoscaling. Organization running a promotion: Manual scaling is a better option here since this is a one-off event with a known duration. Sudden influx of requests: The increasing burst of activity could be caused by a Denial of Service attack that is attempting to overwhelm your system. Autoscaling wouldn't solve the problem.",

    "question": "Your company has developed a web application that experiences intermittent high traffic volumes. However, the company has noticed that during the sudden traffic spikes, the performance of their application temporarily degrades before it starts to stabilize. The degradation is especially apparent when the application hasn't received any significant traffic for a while. How can you mitigate this performance degradation issue?",
    "answer": "The problem your company experiences is called _cold boot_. In order to mitigate it, you need Automatic Scaling with pre-warmed/always ready instances. This requires at least `PremiumV2` plan. Azure Manual Scaling lacks real-time adjustment capabilities, making it inefficient for sudden traffic spikes. Although Azure Autoscale scales based on traffic, it can still experience \"cold starts\" during sudden traffic spikes.

    "answer": "When you exceed the request limits in Azure Container Registry, [throttling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-skus#throttling) occurs, resulting in an `HTTP 429 error`. The recommended solution is implementing retry logic with exponential backoff to handle the temporary throttling and resume operations smoothly. Upgrading the tier isn’t necessary to resolve throttling.",
    "options": [
      "The registry will throttle all pull and push operations, resulting in an `HTTP 429 error`, and you will need to upgrade your service tier to continue operations.",
      "The registry will begin returning `HTTP 503 errors`, and you must reconfigure your container deployment pipeline to reduce the frequency of image pulls and pushes.",
      "The registry will temporarily throttle pull and push operations, returning an `HTTP 429 error`, and you should implement retry logic with exponential backoff to mitigate the issue.",
      "The registry will continue to operate normally, but container operations will slow down as a result of throttling, requiring no further intervention."

    "question": "You have an ASP.NET Core application running within an Azure Container Instance (ACI) and your monitoring team has a unique container image loaded with their monitoring tools. To ensure compliance, you have been tasked with attaching a \"sidecar\" container (an auxiliary container that works alongside the main application container) from the same host. However, you must take into account that the solution should be cost-effective and require minimal changes to the current application, keeping the setup simple. What Azure service would you employ to realize this objective?",
    "answer": "The most suitable service to accomplish this is Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Groups. This service allows you to run multiple containers, maintained by different teams, deployed together as a group on the same host. Each deployed container instance will share the resources of the host and are able to communicate which each other (in this case: your application and the monitoring sidecar). This offers an economical solution without the need for significant changes to your existing application, and it aligns with the sidecar container model. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows running multiple containers on the same host, which supports the sidecar pattern. However, it introduces additional complexity and potential cost increases due to the need for managing clusters and implementing scaling features. Azure App Services provides a platform for hosting web applications and RESTful APIs, including those in containers. The downside is that it does not natively support the sidecar pattern and can lead to higher costs as the scale of operations increases. Azure Container Registry serves as a storage and management solution for container images. It is primarily a storage service and does not provide the functionalities to deploy containers or implement the sidecar pattern. Azure Service Fabric is a platform that provides orchestration of microservices and containers, and could technically support the sidecar pattern. However, it requires a deeper understanding of the microservices architecture and might not be the most cost-effective or simple solution for running a single application with a monitoring sidecar.",

This is ideal for scenarios where you have multiple containers that do not require a high volume of operations and you want to optimize costs. Dedicated throughput is specified at the container (not at dayabase level) level and would be more expensive for a scenario where the containers do not have a high volume of operations. Shared throughput is not assigned at the container level but at the database level.",
    "options": [
      "Assign dedicated throughput to each container individually, ensuring each has enough to handle its expected load.",
      "Assign shared throughput at the database level, allowing all containers to draw from a common pool of throughput.",
      "Assign dedicated throughput at the database level, ensuring the entire database has enough to handle its expected load.",
      "Assign shared throughput to each container individually, allowing each to draw from its own pool of throughput."

    "answer": "A security principal in Azure RBAC is an object that represents a user, group, service principal, or managed identity that is requesting access to Azure resources. It's not a collection of permissions (that's a role definition), it's not the set of resources that the access applies to (that's scope), and it's not the process of attaching a role definition to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity (that's a role assignment).",

Later, you decide to assign a deny assignment at the subscription scope that blocks the user from deleting resources. However, you want to allow the user to delete resources within a specific resource group. What should you do?",
    "answer": "Deny assignments in Azure RBAC take precedence over role assignments. Therefore, even if the user has the Contributor or Owner role at the resource group scope, the deny assignment at the subscription scope would still block them from deleting resources. The only way to allow the user to delete resources within the specific resource group would be to remove (not applicable per requirement) or change the scope of the deny assignment at the subscription scope (not listed).

    "answer": "Regenerating the SAS token does not affect the stored access policy. The SAS token and the stored access policy are separate entities. The SAS token uses the stored access policy, but regenerating the SAS token does not change the stored access policy. Modifying the storage account key does not directly affect the stored access policy. The stored access policy is associated with the storage account, not the key. However, if you regenerate the storage account key that was used to create a SAS token, it will revoke the SAS token, but not the stored access policy itself.",

    "question": "ViralTrendz Inc. operates a popular platform for sharing short videos (think TikTok on a dose of creative steroids) and stores users' videos in Azure with Geo-Redundant Storage with Read Access (GRS-RA). Suddenly, day-to-day operations are disturbed by a full-blown zombie outbreak in the region of their primary storage.

However, in an act of divine intervention, the Almighty, having grown disgruntled at humanity's fixation with endless scrolling, decides to express His displeasure. A bolt from the blue strikes and burns down their data center in San Francisco! In this divinely dramatic situation, what could be the fate of Facebook's legions of users, thumbing their way to oblivion?

So, our Facebook loyalists will scroll on, blissfully oblivious to the celestial drama. The other options paint more drastic scenarios than ZRS - a robust choice - would allow. \"A forced hiatus on their social media activities.\" is not quite accurate because even with one data center under the weather (literally), the remaining zones will keep the network alive. \"The remaining zones will buckle under the data weight\" doesn't take into account the resilience of ZRS - the unaffected zones are fully equipped to manage the load. \"A brief moment of digital silence until Facebook Inc. orchestrates a failover to the unaffected zones.\" isn't the case here, as ZRS doesn't require a manual failover. \"Facebook's misguided choice of ZRS\". is incorrect, because ZRS can protect against such occurrences.",

The company is planning a strategy to enhance disaster recovery capabilities and is considering moving to GZRS. What would be the main advantage for the company to switch from GRS to GZRS?",
    "answer": "The data would be copied across three Azure availability zones in the primary region, improving disaster resilience.\nExplanation: Both GRS and GZRS provide high durability, and both perform synchronous and asynchronous replication. However, GZRS improves resilience by copying data across three Azure availability zones in the primary region, which is beneficial for disaster recovery. Both GRS and GZRS replicate data asynchronously to a secondary region after a write operation, so this does not provide a unique advantage for GZRS.\nBoth GRS and GZRS copy data synchronously three times within the primary region, so this characteristic doesn't differentiate GZRS as a better choice for enhancing disaster resilience.\nBoth GRS and GZRS provide high durability of 99.99999999999999% (16 9's) over a given year.

So, even if one zone becomes unavailable, the data is still accessible from the other zones. GZRS does not replicate the data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region. Replicating the data asynchronously to a secondary region is more about ensuring geographical redundancy and doesn't provide immediate availability during an outage in the primary region.

That's because the SSL certificate, used to serve over HTTPS, must be issued to the exact domain that's being accessed, and Azure Storage does not provide the ability to upload a custom SSL certificate.\nAzure Storage Account Geo-redundancy provides data redundancy across regions, but does not provide the same content delivery speed benefits as Azure CDN. Azure Traffic Manager is for network routing optimization and does not manage content caching for global distribution. Azure Load Balancer is used to distribute network traffic, but doesn't provide content caching like a CDN.",
